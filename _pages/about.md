I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California, and a member of the [Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/).
My advisor is [Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari](https://ceng.usc.edu/~bkrishna/).

My research aims to strengthen the resilience and fairness of the internet's core infrastructure by advancing networking technologies that support decentralization and counteract consolidation.
I am particularly interested in studying the cloud-centric internet to understand its dynamics and develop strategies that promote a more open and decentralized ecosystem.
To achieve these goals, I draw on methods from disciplines such as internet measurement, distributed systems, and applied cryptography.

I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from [IIIT Allahabad](https://iiita.ac.in/) in 2018.
Between then and joining USC, I worked as a software engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/), where I was part of the routing team.
