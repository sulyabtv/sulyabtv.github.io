I am a fifth year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California, and a member of the [ANT Lab](https://ant.isi.edu/).
My advisor is [Prof. John Heidemann](https://ant.isi.edu/~johnh/).

My research revolves around understanding and counteracting Internet centralization and enhancing user privacy, using Internet measurement and protocol design as tools. 
Recently, I have been studying IPv6 adoption and the privacy risks and opportunities created by the shift to IPv6.
Previously, I focused on decentralized reputation mechanisms for blockchain applications.

I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from [IIIT Allahabad](https://iiita.ac.in/) in 2018.
Between then and joining USC, I worked as a software engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/), where I was part of the routing team.
