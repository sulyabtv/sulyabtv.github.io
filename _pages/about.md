I am a second year [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) PhD student at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) in the [Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/), where I am advised by [Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari](https://ceng.usc.edu/~bkrishna/). My research interests are mainly in Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Networking.

I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from [IIIT Allahabad](https://iiita.ac.in/) in 2018. Between then and joining USC, I worked as a software engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/), where I was part of the routing team.

Many eons ago, I used to write, mainly in my mother tongue [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam). Most of my works can be found at [my personal blog](https://sulyab.wordpress.com/).
