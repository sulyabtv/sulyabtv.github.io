I am a third year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California, conducting research in the [Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/) under the guidance of [Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari](https://ceng.usc.edu/~bkrishna/). My research interests are mainly in Computer Networks and Blockchain.

I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from [IIIT Allahabad](https://iiita.ac.in/) in 2018. Between then and joining USC, I worked as a software engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/), where I was part of the routing team.
