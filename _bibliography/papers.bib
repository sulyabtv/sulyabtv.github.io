  abstract={Although the earliest electronic micropayment schemes date back to the mid-90s, recent years have witnessed a resurgence of research interest in the field due to the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies and the associated increase in transaction fees. Probabilistic micropayment schemes have shown particular theoretical promise due to their ability to aggregate payments beyond client-merchant pairs. In this paper, we review various probabilistic micropayment protocols proposed in both pre-cryptocurrency and post-cryptocurrency eras and provide an analysis of what the future of research in this field could look like.},
